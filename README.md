# UPY_IntelLabs-NucVision-

🚀 Overview

Let us introduce ourselves. We are the students. Rolando Lopez, Mauricio Laguna and Luis Romero
it's a pleasure to meet you, I hope this guide will be useful for you.
so, lets Start.

Hi UPY students.This repository provides a step-by-step guide and codebase to train YOLO models on Intel GPUs, leveraging hardware acceleration through Intel Extension for PyTorch (IPEX) and OpenVINO Toolkit. It is designed for developers and researchers who want to utilize Intel GPUs (e.g., Intel Arc, integrated GPUs) for efficient deep learning workflows instead of traditional NVIDIA/CUDA setups.

✨ Key Features

- ✅ Intel GPU Support: Train YOLO models on Intel GPUs via device="xpu" (requires Intel drivers and IPEX).



- 🚄 Optimized Performance: Accelerate training and inference with Intel-optimized libraries (IPEX, OpenVINO).



- 📦 Easy Setup: Ready-to-use scripts for installation, dataset configuration, and training.



- 🔄 Conversion to OpenVINO: Export models to OpenVINO format for deployment on Intel CPUs/GPUs.



🛠️Installation & Usage

-  Prerequisites
- Intel GPU (Arc, UHD, Iris Xe, or newer) with drivers installed(Intel Nuc uses ARC GPU)
- Python and pip.

📝 Why This Repository?

* If you are here, it is very likely that you are stuck in getting your vision code compatible with the Asus Nuc computer in the lab. YOLO tutorials are focused on NVIDIA GPUs, so this tutorial was created to help you use this information effectively in the future so that you can advance faster in the development of computer vision technology.

🛠️How to configure Intel GPUs for deep learning.🛠️

* Performance optimizations using IPEX and OpenVINO.

* Best practices for dataset preparation and model deployment on Intel hardware.
